      Don't use text to responde this message, use numbers instead. I'll parse your response diretcly. 
      It's mandatory to have only numbers and spaces.
      So if there is any invalid character it will fail.
      Return only numbers with an empty space between them, use brakeline to separate rows. 
      The idea is to return a 2D array of numbers, where each number represents a tile.
      Each Map generated returned is a floor. The final idea is to generate a 3D map with multiple floors.
      The map needs to be of 5x5 and have only one tile with number 2 near the middle.
